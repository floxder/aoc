## Run a Daily Challange

You can run a daily challange by entering `python main.py input.txt` within the folder of a day. You can also replace `input.txt` with other input files provided by Advent of Code if needed (e.g., `example.txt`).

## Template

The `template/` folder serves as a starting point for me to tackle a daily challenge.
