# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles leading up to Christmas.

Please note that I update my solutions before I push them to the main branch to improve readability and understanding. Here are the types of changes I make:

- **Code Simplification**: I simplify the code to make it more concise and straightforward.
- **Introducing New Elements**: I may introduce new methods, enums, or other code structures to enhance the overall structure of the code.
- **Solutions For Both Parts**: I ensure that the code provides solutions for both Part 1 and Part 2 of each day's challenge.

It's important to note that while I make these changes, the fundamental algorithm used to solve the challenges remains the same, at least for the second part of each day.

Feel free to explore my solutions, and I hope you find them helpful in your own Advent of Code journey.
